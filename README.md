# Srcs-to-Redshift-ETL
This project is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline that extracts data from various sources, including a PostgreSQL database, a JSON file, and a CSV file. It then performs data transformations to optimize it for data analysis before loading it into an Amazon Redshift database on AWS.
